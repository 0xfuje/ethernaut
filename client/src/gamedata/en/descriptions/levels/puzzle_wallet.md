Nowadays, paying for DeFi operations is impossible, fact. A group of friends discovered that one of them managed to slightly decrease the cost of sending multiple transactions by chaining them under one same roof. After the friends discovered this, they asked the dev to allow them to use the wallet too, so the dev agreed and accounted for the value deposited by each to use it as its threshold. At the same time, the dev improved the wallet by allowing the admin to upgrade its functionality without removing the deposited funds, which would be unnecessary expensive. Of course, the admin would veil for the best interest of the wallet and therefore it was applied 2 rules: a new admin can be accepted by the old admin after a new proposed admin has been submitted, and that { TODO: how can you become an admin besides proposing/accepting? }. Everyone thought it was fair and agreed with the change.

The dev deployed the contracts, everyone whitelisted in the group of friends started to deposit their funds into it, and cheered for their accomplishment against evil miners.

However, little that they knew, their lunch money was at risk…

To pass this level, you’ll need to hijack this wallet to become the owner and remove all funds stored there.
