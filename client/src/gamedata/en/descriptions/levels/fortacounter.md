This level will introduce you to Forta agents. Forta agents are a new powerful tool aimed to monitor the blockchain for specific things to happen and react to those firing a notification.

Nowadays decentralized protocols and applications are really complex and might touch different smart contracts at the same time. Monitoring for specific events or actions to happens might help into promptely be aware and possibly react to those actions.

For this, an agent is a specific programmable process that will fire alerts upon events. Agents are off-chain process that monitor on-chain events, but for the educational purpose we modeled here an Agent in the form of a smart contract.

Your goal is to make the `counter` variable to increment without triggering the agent and avoiding getting notified by the change.
